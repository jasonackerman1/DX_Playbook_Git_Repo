# KM_Playbook_MDB5_Template

Hello KM Curriculum Developers and Coders,

When we are first starting talking about developing a new playbook, or redesigning an exsisting playbook, we we'll "fork" this repo to start the process.

Getting the Git Hub workflow ironed out for the playbook we are about to start, should be the first thing we address. Having this conversation extremely early could save time and headaches if the Git repo is not set up.

It is important that we use this repo template because it took tons of time to "commit" and "pull" MDB5s file structure. Since Git Hub times out very quickly during the "pull" process, I would suggest never "pull" more than 40 "commits."

If you have any questions using this repo template please email me at: bpierce@kmbs.konicaminolta.us and I'll be happy to assist you.

<b> Thanks! </b>
